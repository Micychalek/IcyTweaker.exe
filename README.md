## FAQ

#### Is it bannable

No! The application does not interfere with the game files or anything related to it. It only changes network settings, network card or other non-game related stuff. Even though it does not change game settings you can feel a significant difference in the game.

#### Is it safe for my PC?

Yes and no. Since every PC is different it is impossible to make an app that will work perfectly fine on any computer device. I highly recommend creating a RESTORE POINT before using our app. Do it for your own safety!
